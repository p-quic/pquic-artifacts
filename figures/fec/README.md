# Counting the protoops
The `count_protoops_sigcomm19.sh` file will help you to count the number of protoops considered for FEC in the article.
This script takes one argument: the path to the directory containing the FEC protoops in PQUIC so that it can count it (e.g. `./plugins/fec/`).
Make sure you executed the `make` command in the FEC directory of PQUIC before executing this script.
